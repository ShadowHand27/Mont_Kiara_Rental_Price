# Mont_Kiara_Rental_Price
This is personal project on the market price psft of commercial housing in Mont Kiara.
A tenant of mine has requested for a reduction on the rental.
In order to determine the current going market rate, I have created the following violin plot showing the distribution of houses prices per square feet (psft) for all the properties listed on iProperty within Mont Kiara.
This project involes the following;
- web-scraping
- data cleaning
- data visualization using Seaborn
